These files perform the analysis used in the paper

'Objectively identifying landmark use and predicting flight trajectories in the homing pigeon using Gaussian procresses'

to predict actual flight paths (contained in data/allSites40k.mat)

the data file is in the following structure: allSites40k(site).bird(bird_number).path{flight_number}.

the sites are: 1.Horspath. 2. Weston Wood 3. Bladon Heath 4. Church Hanborough

run this:

for site = 1:4
getResultsScript;
end
put_all_together;

Now the output variable 'bigX2' should correspond to the curve in Figure 1, with upper and lower quartiles given by bigeX2(:, 1:2)
